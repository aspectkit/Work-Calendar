# Work Calendar

## Description

This website allows the user to plan out their work day by inputting events into time blocks and saving them. I learned about using apis like jquery, dayjs, bootstrap, and google font apis to create this application.

## Usage

The user can see the current date at the top of the page. The user can input text into the time blocks below to plan their day. The user can see if the approximate time with the color coordination. Gray is in the past, Red is the present, and Green is the future. The user can then save their text to local storage so they can leave and come back and their day plan will still be there.
